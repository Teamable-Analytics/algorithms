# Snapshot Details

This branch retains the truth of the repository by 2024/09/30. This includes the work needed to generate
the benchmarking graphs and the API setup. The `main` branch will now start heavily deviating from this 
version of the repo so this marks a point in time that we could hypothetically return to in a future case.

Make sure to reset the commit from https://github.com/Teamable-Analytics/algorithms-simulation-cache to a
commit that is nearest to this snapshot's date.

Also consider that there are other git submodules in this repo that must be considered.
